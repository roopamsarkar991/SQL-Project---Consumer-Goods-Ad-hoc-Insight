# SQL-Project---Consumer-Goods-Ad-hoc-Insight

Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. specializes in selling computers and accessories.

The management noticed that they did not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. However, Tony Sharma (Data Analytics Director ) wants to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. So he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both tech and soft skills

Now the company wants insights for 10 ad hoc / business requests.

This project is part of the data analytics boot camp at codebasics.

The 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database was provided to me to work on and it includes six main tables:

dim_customer: contains customer-related data
dim_product: contains product-related data
fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.


Tools used -
I used My SQL to answer the questions
and Power BI for visualization
